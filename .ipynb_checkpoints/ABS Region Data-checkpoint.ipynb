    "The goal of this notebook will be to explore data compiled from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) compiled as part of their [AUSSTATS](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1410.02013-18?OpenDocument) documentation, looking at trends across a wide variety of \"key measures\" by geographical region within Australia.\n",

    "Note all files were originally \".xls\" format, and have had incredibly minor alterations as follows:\n",
    "* Removing \"branding\" and \"page header\" rows (rows 1-5 in source document)\n",
    "* Removing \"Copyright\" and empty \"footer\" columns at the end of the dataset\n",
    "* Consolidating all the details outlined in the column headers into 1 header per column (removing merged formatting and cross filling for empty cells)\n",
    "* Saving each document as .csv\n",
    "\n",
    "All files are based on the ASGS (Australian Statistical Geography Standard) location methodology. There is potential of further exploration based on documents located [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1270.0.55.003July%202011?OpenDocument)."

    "Very interesting that there is a high correlation between number of individuals on government pensions and those earning annuities, and even moreso that there is a *negative* correlation with the share of high income earners and number of solar panels, which also flows through into total household income.\n",

    "Okay, so the data at least makes sense - there is a strong negative correlation between population density and solar installations per household, owing to some key factors regarding building composition within the region:\n",
    "* More renters in the region result in less solar investment (they are unlikely to reap the long term capital benefits)\n",
    "* Greater number of apartment buildings\n",
    "* I'm not sure about this one, but number of households with neither rooms to spare nor rooms needed, so perfectly utilised. My best guess is this figure itself is closely associated with renting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other observations leap out at me:\n",
    "* The positive correlation with 55-64 year old residents\n",
    "* The negative correlation with immigrants and non-citizens\n",
    "* The negative correlation with overall income, but positive correlation with income between $500-999 per week\n",
    "* Positive correlations with income earners' ages\n",
    "* A *very* surprising negative correlation with gifts and donations! Goes to show that this particular \"green\" signal is not an indicator of altruistic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also interesting to note the overwhelming amount of strong negative correlations, solar has a lot going against it apparently!\n",
    "\n",
    "Annoyingly, there seem to be some direct duplicate columns in the dataset (note the \"no..1 and no..2\" variables) so I will need some way of eliminating these before running PCA and other ML techniques over the data to ensure that coefficients aren't distorted by this duplication.\n",
